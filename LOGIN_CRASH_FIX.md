# Login Screen Crash Fix

## Problem
The login screen was getting stuck and causing the app to crash due to:
1. **Circular dependency**: The `usePermissions` hook was recreating the `requestPermissions` function on every render
2. **Infinite re-renders**: The `useEffect` was triggering repeatedly because `requestPermissions` was in the dependency array
3. **Complex hook chain**: The permission hook was causing unnecessary complexity for a simple one-time permission request

## Solution
Simplified the permission request implementation:

### 1. **Removed Hook Dependency**
- Removed `usePermissions` import and usage from LoginScreen
- Directly imported `requestAllPermissions` function using dynamic import
- This eliminates the circular dependency issue

### 2. **Fixed useEffect Dependencies**
```tsx
// BEFORE (causing crashes):
useEffect(() => {
  // ...
}, [requestPermissions]); // requestPermissions recreated on every render

// AFTER (fixed):
useEffect(() => {
  const requestAppPermissions = async () => {
    const { requestAllPermissions } = await import('../utils/permissions');
    await requestAllPermissions();
  };
  // ...
}, []); // Empty dependency array - runs only once
```

### 3. **Enhanced Logging**
- Added better console logging with emojis for easier debugging
- Clear permission status indicators (✅ granted, ❌ denied, ℹ️ unavailable)
- Summarized permission results

## Changes Made

### `/src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx`
- Removed `usePermissions` hook import and usage
- Used dynamic import for `requestAllPermissions` function
- Fixed `useEffect` to have empty dependency array
- Simplified permission request logic

### `/src/utils/permissions.ts`
- Enhanced logging with better visual indicators
- Added permission summary logging
- Improved error handling and console output

## Benefits
- ✅ **No more crashes**: Eliminated circular dependency and infinite re-renders
- ✅ **Cleaner code**: Removed unnecessary hook complexity for simple one-time request
- ✅ **Better debugging**: Enhanced console logging for permission status
- ✅ **Stable performance**: useEffect runs only once on component mount
- ✅ **Same functionality**: Still requests all permissions silently on app start

## How It Works Now
1. LoginScreen mounts
2. After 500ms delay, permissions are requested once using direct function import
3. Results are logged to console with clear status indicators
4. App continues normally without any crashes or stuck screens

The fix maintains the original requirement of requesting permissions silently without UI elements, but eliminates the crash-causing circular dependency issue.
